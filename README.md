Here in this assignment i have created the project in google sheets to import csv file and import data successfully.
I have created the code.gs and index.html in app scripts which is a google sheet extension.
Then I achieved the problem statement like if the existing data is there in the same page then it moves automatically to new page and loads the data again.
